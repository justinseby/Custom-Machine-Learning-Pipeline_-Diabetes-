##What are the Benefits of Machine Learning Pipeline?
Constructing ML Pipelines provides many advantages. Some of them are: Flexibility Computation units are easy to replace. For better implementation, it is possible to rework that part without changing the rest of the system.Extensibility When the system is partitioned into pieces, it is easy to create new functionality.Scalability Each part of the computation is presented via a standard interface. If any part has an issue, it is possible to scale that component separately.
