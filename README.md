#What are the Benefits of Machine Learning Pipeline?
Constructing ML Pipelines provides many advantages. Some of them are: Flexibility Computation units are easy to replace. For better implementation, it is possible to rework that part without changing the rest of the system.Extensibility When the system is partitioned into pieces, it is easy to create new functionality.Scalability Each part of the computation is presented via a standard interface. If any part has an issue, it is possible to scale that component separately. 

#Dataset Definition
We will use Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

#Context
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
